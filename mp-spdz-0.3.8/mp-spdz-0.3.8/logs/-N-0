The following benchmarks are including preprocessing (offline phase).
Time = 0.0112602 seconds 
Data sent = 0.123184 MB in ~53 rounds (party 0 only; use '-v' for more details)
Global data sent = 0.256608 MB (all parties)
This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of your code:
	program.use_trunc_pr = True
	program.use_split(2)
