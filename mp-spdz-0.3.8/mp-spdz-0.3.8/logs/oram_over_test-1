Trying to run 64-bit computation
Starting timer 10000 at 0 (0 MB, 0 rounds) after 3.564e-06
Stopped timer 10000 at 5941.07 (12523.3 MB, 64369661 rounds)
The following benchmarks are including preprocessing (offline phase).
Time = 5941.1 seconds 
Time10000 = 5941.07 seconds (12523.3 MB, 64369661 rounds)
Data sent = 12523.5 MB in ~64369967 rounds (party 1 only; use '-v' for more details)
Global data sent = 37570.5 MB (all parties)
This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of your code:
	program.use_trunc_pr = True
	program.use_split(3)
