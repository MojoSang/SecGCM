Using statistical security parameter 40
Trying to run 64-bit computation
The following benchmarks are including preprocessing (offline phase).
Time = 0.0114922 seconds 
Data sent = 0.133424 MB in ~46 rounds (party 1 only; use '-v' for more details)
Global data sent = 0.256608 MB (all parties)
This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of your code:
	program.use_trunc_pr = True
	program.use_split(2)
